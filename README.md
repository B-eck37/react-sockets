# React-Sockets - Real-Time Communication
#### [socket.io](https://socket.io/) 

This Repository is a demonstration on the usage of Socket.IO and integrating its capabilities with create-react-app. I hope you enjoy and please feel free to use this information for yourself, as you'll see there are multiple uses for this advanced technology.

## To begin, lets first understand what WebSockets are.

### Full Answer: 
WebSockets are an advanced technology that makes an open interactive communication session open between the user's browser and a server. With this, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply (MDN)

### Interfaces:

- WebSocket is the primary interface for connecting to a WebSocket server and then sending and receiving data on the same connection.

- CloseEvent is the event sent by the WebSocket object when the connection closes.

- MessageEvent is the event sent by the WebSocket object when a message is received from the server.

## What's this mean to us?

- [socket.io](https://socket.io/) enables real-time bidirectional event-based communications.
- We can achieve a list of dynamic uses with this technology, such as: creating a live-chat platform, collaborating on a document and displaying real-time analytics. 
- Many companies, such as Trello and Microsoft Office, have already adopted this technology into their applications. 

### Disclaimer 

There are many ways to use and capitalize on socket.io. While this repository only covers basic ways of using this technology, it is only ment to be an introduction for you to start exploring WebSockets on your own.
